<page>Generic Options Screen</page>
The Options screen is extremely generic and is used in several places through-out the system. Perhaps most commonly in the Order Enquiry screen to modify the Order Status. The screen is used to translate values from a Code which is stored in the database to the Description which is displayed on the screen.
