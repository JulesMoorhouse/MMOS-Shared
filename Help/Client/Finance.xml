The 'Finance Screen' should be regard as a sort of cash book (its referred to as such through-out the help file). A place were monies relating to orders can be shown.<br/><br/>

The data shown in the cash book comes from cheques and credit card payments for normal orders and again for refund orders.  There is also a section shown under payments, monies the customer owes your company.<br/><br/>

Another point worth mentioning, is when an order total comes to more than the customer has permitted you to take from his/her credit card.  This will generate an Under payment, as it is unreasonable to take money without consent.  This will likely happen only for orders received through the post.<br/><br/>

The most complicated area, is that of Refunds.  Refunds can be generated when the order is packed / confirmed or when a customer returns good.<br/><br/>
