# MMOS-Shared 

The MMOS-Shared repository contains the databases and help files required by MMOS. It also contains some batch files, which allows all of the programs to be built. These are useful if you make changes to the common code subtree repository.

I've included three help files, the client help file is complete.

However the other two help files aren't finished. I do have some html help pages which need contverting to the chm format, but this would be a manual process.
